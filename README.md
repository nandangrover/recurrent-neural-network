<h3 align="center"> RNN for sequence-to-sequence classification</h3>

## What we have built?
We have built a RNN, GRU and LST for the development of our Binary Classification models. When trained on a similar architecture, all of the models gave similarly high accuracy of about ~99%. Though RNNs proved to be slower compared to the newer LSTMs and GRUs, the accuracy of our Binary classifier was not affected.
